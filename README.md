# neurodynamics
This repo is for collecting notebooks and hopefully some fun interactive explorations of modeling ideas from BENG 260 / PHYS 279.
Ideas collected here are from Dr. Henry Abarbanel's version of the neurodynamics course at UCSD, and from oscillator work by Ed Large and Ji Chul at UConn.
