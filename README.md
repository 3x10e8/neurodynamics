# neurodynamics
This repo is for collecting notebooks and hopefully some fun interactive explorations of modeling ideas from neurodynamics. This is a work in progress, so if you see any bugs or would like to contribute, thank you and you are welcome!

## Hodgkin-Huxley models
[NaKL.ipynb](NaKL.ipynb) explores modeling of neurons using Na, K, and leak conductances.

[gating_variables.ipynb](gating_variables.ipynb) is aimed at exploring synapses, but isn't complete just yet.

[Data_Assimilation.ipynb](Data_Assimilation.ipynb) has some initial lecture notes from professor Henry Abarbanel's class on neurodynamics at UCSD, implementation to follow.

## Oscillator models
In a departure from modeling indiviual neurons, the following notebook explores abstracted dyanmical models from Ed Large's MusicDynamicsLab at UConn:

[single_oscillator_model.ipynb](single_oscillator_model.ipynb)

[two_speakers_example.ipynb](two_speakers_example.ipynb) is more to play around with librosa, would could eventually provide input stimuli for the oscillator models.
